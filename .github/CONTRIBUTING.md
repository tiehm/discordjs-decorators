# Contributing

>**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and suggestion, please go to my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aGqXVF2) for anything else instead of opening an issue here..**

If you wish to contribute to the discordjs-decorators codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. I use tslint to enforce a consistent coding style and jest / ts-jest to test the code.

## Setup
To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **master** branch
2. Run `yarn`
3. Do something productive
4. Build with ``yarn build``
5. Run `yarn test` to run the tests
6. Run the implementation tests with your own bot (if you changed anything in the codebase) ``yarn test:discord``
7. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/tiehm/discordjs-decorators/compare)
